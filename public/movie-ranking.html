<h3>The 100 Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie of all time, it's so ridicule and amazing at the same time.</p>
<h3>Disney's Tarzan</h3>
<p>Going to the premiere with my dad is one of my best memories with him.</p>
<h3>My Big Fat Greek Wedding</h3>
<p>My future wife always puts this movie whenever she feels sad or down.</p>
